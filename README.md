# GradientBoostingClassifier
Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) is an ensemble machine learning technique used for both classification and regression tasks. 
It builds a model in a sequential manner, where each new model (usually a decision tree) corrects the errors of the previous ones. 
GBM is particularly powerful because it focuses on the hard-to-predict examples by giving them more weight in the learning process.

## Boosting
Boosting is one of the popular learning ensemble modeling techniques used to build strong classifiers from various weak classifiers. 
It starts with building a primary model from available training data sets then it identifies the errors present in the base model. 
After identifying the error, a secondary model is built, and further, a third model is introduced in this process. 
In this way, this process of introducing more models is continued until we get a complete training data set by which model predicts correctly.
